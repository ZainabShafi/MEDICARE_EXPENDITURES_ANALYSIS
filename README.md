OVERVIEW(see below for a more detailed project overview): 

This study analyzed 4 years of CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) claims expenditure data spanning 2019-2022 and formulated the following questions for exploration: 
How does Medicare spending behavior vary across states, and what is the impact of COVID-19?
Which claim types see the highest spending? 
Which claim periods see the highest spending?
Is there a trend of rising average spending, and how is COVID-19 influencing it?
What forecasts can the data provide for future Medicare spending trends?

Through answering these questions with evidence from the chosen data, this investigation was successfully able to present distinct patterns in Medicare claims expenditures, and observe the impact COVID-19 had on these patterns.

QUESTION FORMULATION: 

After an initial overview of our data and recognizing the main varibles or data points in the files, we unearthed important entry points for analysis. Through understanding patterns of claims spending on a granular level, (for eg. What was the most spent on claim type?) we were able to apply relevant filters to the data to get a clearer picture of Medicare claims spending and the story it tells about Medicare's functions.

PROJECT IMPROVEMENTS/ADDITIONS: 

An interesting and revealing avenue for analysis for Medicare claims spending during COVID this group hopes to use to enhance this project, is State's policy responses to COVID. Did States with more lax masing laws see more hospitalizations? And did those hospitlizations directly correlate with higher claims spending in those States?

The datasets under analysis describe average hospital spending levels of Medicare beneficiary episodes, and span over the years 2019-2022. This study has chosen to focus on this time period to analyze how hospital spending behavior on Medicare Claims was impacted by the COVID National Health Emergency (referred to as NHE). Before delving into the discoveries made by this study, it is pivotal to understand the data by briefly discussing the different types of Medicare claims and their timelines (or ‘duration periods’). 

Medicare (founded in 1958) is a federal health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and older, and plays a substantial role in the health care system. According to KFF, an independent resource for health policy research, “...Medicare Accounts for 21% of National Health Spending and 10% of the Federal Budget.”. Generally speaking, Medicare financing is available for claims classified as Part A, B, C and D. These classifications are made according to types of care or types of facility,  with Part A encompassing “....inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and some home health care.  

 The data under analysis focuses on claims under Medicare’s Part A, since these are the claims most medical facilities will be processing as they have to do with direct patient care. The claims included in the data are as follows: Home Health Agency, Hospice, Inpatient, Outpatient, Skilled Nursing Facility, Durable Medical Equipment, and Carrier (‘Carrier’ claim types refer to health insurance companies outside the scope of Medicare, for which it is able to commit partial funding for specific claims). Hospital spending on each claim type is recorded through a designated duration period, of which there are three categories : “1 to 3 days Prior to Index Hospital Admission", “During Index Hospital Admission”, and “1 through 30 days After Discharge from Index Hospital Admission”. “Index Hospital Admission”, refers to the first day a patient is admitted to the hospital or medical facility. 

As the visual representations of the data will exhibit,  hospitals tend to spend the most on average on Inpatient claims, since these claims regard those individuals currently admitted in a hospital or medical facilities and require urgent care and assistance. Furthermore, the data exhibits that hospital spending trends higher on Inpatient claims made ‘During Index Hospital Admission’ - as these class of claims apply to patients who are admitted in the hospital at the time the claim is made. A final critical aspect of the data that this study will further examine through various plots and graphs, is that the  U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS)made the decision to omit claims based data from public record from the first 2 quarters of 2020. The statement released reads as follows: 

“CMS will omit Quarter 1 and Quarter 2 2020 (January 1–June 30, 2020) data from publicly reporting, including claims-based measures. CMS will include data from Q3 2020 (July 1, 2020) onward.While the COVID-19 PHE did not end June 30, 2020, CMS is committed to empowering consumers to make informed decisions.” It can be concluded that the CMS made the decision to omit this data based on the inaccurate representation of Medicare claims spending, which was skewed by the immense patient load in hospitals during the PHE. The data for the other three years under analysis begins January 1st and ends Dec 31st of each year, whereas for 2020 the data begins in July - meaning that 6 months of data was omitted from public record.
